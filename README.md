# Parallel-File-Processing-System

##  Project Idea

In this project, we aim to *analyze large files (CSV, JSON, XML)* containing millions of lines using *parallel programming (Multi-threading)* to speed up the processing.

The system will perform tasks such as:  
- *Counting occurrences*  
- *Extracting specific data*  
- *Data cleaning*  

Finally, we will *merge the results and display a summary report*.

## Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ File Splitting
- The large file will be divided into smaller *chunks*.
- Each chunk will contain a specific number of lines.

### 2️⃣ Parallel Processing
- Multiple *threads* will process each chunk independently.
- We will use *Thread Pool (Executors)* or *Fork/Join Framework* to manage the threads efficiently.

### 3️⃣ Thread-safe Data Handling
- Results will be stored during processing using *ConcurrentHashMap* to ensure safe concurrent access and avoid synchronization issues.

### 4️⃣ Merging Results
- After all threads finish processing, partial results will be *merged* to generate the *final output*.
- A *summary report* will be displayed for the user.
